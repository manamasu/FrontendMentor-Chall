## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I already had some CSS practice and experience, but I still refreshed my knowledge since it's been a while since I used plain CSS and not relied on component libraries.

### Continued development

In the future, I might use a similar card for QR codes or other topics. This project has given me a solid foundation to build upon for such use cases.
